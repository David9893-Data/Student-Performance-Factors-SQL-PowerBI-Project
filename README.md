# üéì Student Performance ‚Äì Dashboard Case Study

## Context  
Education plays a crucial role in shaping future opportunities, but many factors outside the classroom can influence academic outcomes.  
This project aimed to understand how socio-economic background, motivation, parental education, and lifestyle habits impact student exam performance.

The dataset includes variables such as exam scores, study hours, motivation level, access to internet, family income, parental education level, and more.  
The goal was to uncover key insights and provide recommendations to support students more effectively.
