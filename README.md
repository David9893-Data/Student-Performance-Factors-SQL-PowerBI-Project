# Student Performance Factors SQL Project

## Overview
This project explores the various factors influencing student performance using SQL. By analyzing the dataset, we aim to identify trends, correlations, and insights that can provide valuable information to improve student outcomes.
The project involves data cleaning, transformation, and querying techniques to derive actionable insights


## Objective
- **The primary objective of this project is to analyze student performance data to uncover key factors contributing to their academic success or failure. The analysis focuses on:**

- **Identifying trends and patterns in student performance.**

- **Analyzing the impact of various factors such as gender, parental education, and test preparation.**

- **Providing recommendations for improving student outcomes based on insights.**

---

## Dataset

-- The dataset used for this analysis contains anonymized data on student performance. Key fields include:

- **Gender: Male/Female.**

- **Parental Level of Education: Highest level of education completed by the studentâ€™s parents.**

- **Test Preparation Course: Whether the student completed a test preparation course.**

- **Scores: Scores in different subjects (Math, Reading, and Writing).**

--- 

## Tools and Technologies

- **SQL: For data analysis, cleaning, and querying.**

- **MySQL: Database management system used for storing and querying the dataset.**

- **GitHub: Repository to store and showcase the project.**

## 3. Data Analysis

- **Descriptive Analysis:**

- **Average scores by gender.**

- **Distribution of scores across parental education levels.**

- **Comparative Analysis:- **

- **Comparison of scores between students who completed test preparation and those who did not.**

- **Analysis of subject-wise performance trends.**

- **Correlations:- **

- **Relationship between parental education level and student performance.**

- **Impact of gender on scores.**

--- 

## 4. Insights

Key insights derived include:

Students who completed test preparation courses tend to score higher across all subjects.

Parental education level positively correlates with student performance.

Female students showed a slight edge in reading and writing scores, while male students excelled in math.


## Results

The project demonstrates the effectiveness of SQL for analyzing structured datasets and deriving actionable insights. It highlights the importance of external factors such as test preparation and parental education in shaping student performance.
